# AbiVim

This repository is in relation with the [Abinit Project](https://www.abinit.org/) that you can also find on GithuB [here](https://github.com/abinit/abinit). 
\\
AbiVim proposes to set up an autocompleter for Abinit's input files inside vim. It can parse mkdocs.py files from
Abinit's source code to generate lists of relevent data relating to Abinit's input variables.

# Installation

To install the script just clone this repository somewhere 
```
git clone https://github.com/Chaostellaire/vim-autocomplete4abi.git AbiVim
```
or in ssh
```
git clone git@github.com:abinit/abinit.git AbiVim
```

To make the main script work you will also need an **Abinit documentation file**. 
You can find one in [Abinit's Github repo](https://github.com/abinit/abinit) in the _abimkdocs_ directory.
